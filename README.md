## Game Rules

The game is played on a 3x3 grid. Each player takes turns marking their symbol (X or O) on one of the nine squares. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all squares are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a tie.
